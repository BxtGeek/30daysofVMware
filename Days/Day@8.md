## Download and Install ESXi Server (Hypervisor)

To download and install the ESXi server (also known as the hypervisor), follow these steps:

+ Download the ESXi installer: Go to the VMware website and download the latest version of the ESXi installer. You will need to create a VMware account if you don't already have one.

+ Create a bootable USB or DVD: Once the download is complete, use a tool like Rufus to create a bootable USB or DVD from the installer file.

+ Boot from the USB or DVD: Insert the bootable USB or DVD into the server and restart it. Make sure that the server is set to boot from the USB or DVD in the BIOS or UEFI settings.

+ Follow the installation prompts: The installation process will guide you through the steps to install the ESXi server. This will include setting up the server's network configuration, creating a root password, and selecting the storage devices to use for the ESXi installation.

+ Configure the ESXi server: After the installation is complete, you will need to configure the ESXi server to suit your needs. This will include creating virtual machines, setting up storage, and configuring networking.

Note that the exact steps may vary depending on the specific version of ESXi you are using and the hardware configuration of your server. It is recommended to refer to the VMware documentation for detailed instructions on the installation and configuration process.
