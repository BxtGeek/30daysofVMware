## Monitors
vCenter Server includes many built-in monitoring and reporting features that allow IT professionals to monitor the performance and resource usage of their vSphere environment. Some examples of the monitoring features in vCenter Server include:

+ Performance charts: vCenter Server provides performance charts for hosts, virtual machines, and datastores, which can be used to monitor CPU, memory, disk, and network usage.

+ Alarm definitions: vCenter Server allows administrators to set alarms that trigger when certain conditions are met, such as when a virtual machine runs out of memory or when a host's CPU usage exceeds a certain threshold.

+ Events: vCenter Server tracks a wide range of events such as virtual machine power state changes, host disconnections, and configuration changes, which can be viewed in the vSphere Web Client or vSphere Client.

+ vCenter Server also allows to use vRealize Operations (vROps) to monitor and manage the performance, capacity, and health of a vSphere environment. vROps provides advanced analytics, machine learning, and predictive analytics capabilities to quickly identify and resolve performance issues.

+ You can also use third-party tools to monitor vCenter Server, such as Nagios, PRTG Network Monitor or Zabbix, that can integrate with vCenter API to provide additional monitoring capabilities.

These monitoring features provide IT professionals with the information they need to ensure that their vSphere environment is running smoothly and efficiently.

## Configure, Permissions, and Datacenters (Menu)
The vCenter Server web client includes several menus that provide access to various features and functions, including Configure, Permissions, and Datacenters.

+ The Configure menu provides access to settings and configurations for vCenter Server, such as configuring the vCenter Server's hostname or IP address, the SSO (Single Sign-On) administrator password, and the Database settings, as well as managing vCenter Server services, managing vCenter Server licenses, and configuring vCenter Server's settings such as vCenter Server's security settings, and creating and managing vCenter Server plugins.

+ The Permissions menu allows you to manage user and group permissions for vCenter Server objects such as virtual machines, hosts, and datacenters. You can also create and manage roles, which are predefined sets of permissions that can be assigned to users and groups.

+ The Datacenters menu allows you to create and manage datacenters, which are the top-level container objects in vCenter Server. A datacenter can contain multiple clusters, hosts, and virtual machines. The Datacenters menu also allows you to create and manage vSphere datacenter objects such as clusters, hosts, and virtual machines. This menu also allows you to manage datacenter's resource pools, network and storage settings.

All of these menus are accessible through the vCenter Server web client, which can be accessed through a web browser. The vCenter Server web client allows IT professionals to manage and monitor their vSphere environment from a single location.
