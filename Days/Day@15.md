+ Boot the server from the installation media.

+ Follow the prompts to select your language and accept the license agreement.

+ Choose the destination for the installation. This will typically be the local disk of the server.

+ Configure the network settings for the server.

+ Customize the system settings, such as the root password and timezone.

+ Review the installation summary and click "Finish" to begin the installation process.

+ Wait for the installation to complete. This may take several minutes.
