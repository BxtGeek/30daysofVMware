# Day#6

## Lab Design

Today, we will be discussing our lab design and the steps we will take to set it up. Specifically, we will be using our desktop/laptop to install ESXi, which is a virtualization software that allows users to create and manage virtual machines. To demonstrate the capabilities of ESXi, we will be using a solution like VirtualBox.

In our lab design, we will create two ESXi hosts and inside these host, we will set up a Domain Controller. This is a computer that is used to manage network resources and provide services to users within the network. Additionally, we will create one more virtual machine (VM) called vSphere, which will allow us to connect both ESXi hosts in High Availability.

Don't worry if you are unfamiliar with some of these terms â€“ we will be covering them in more detail throughout the challenge. The goal of our lab design is to provide you with a hands-on experience using ESXi and vSphere, and to help you understand how these tools can be used to create a flexible and scalable IT infrastructure.
