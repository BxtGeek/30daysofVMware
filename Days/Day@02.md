## What is Virtualization?

Virtualization refers to the creation of a virtual version of a device or resource, such as a server, operating system, storage device, or network resources. 

It allows multiple operating systems to run on the same physical server or device, and enables organizations to use their hardware resources more efficiently. Virtualization can also be used to create a virtual version of an operating system or application, which can be run on a different platform or device than the one it was originally designed for. 

There are several different types of virtualization, including server virtualization, desktop virtualization, and application virtualization.

## Types of Virtualization?

There are several different types of virtualization:
+ Server virtualization: This involves creating virtual versions of servers, allowing multiple operating systems and applications to run on the same physical server.
+ Desktop virtualization: This involves creating a virtual version of a desktop operating system, allowing users to access their desktop environment from any device with an internet connection.
+ Application virtualization: This involves creating a virtual version of an application, allowing it to be run on a different operating system or device than it was originally designed for.
+ Storage virtualization: This involves creating a virtual version of a storage device, such as a hard drive or a network-attached storage (NAS) device, allowing multiple servers or devices to access the same storage resources.
+ Network virtualization: This involves creating a virtual version of a network, allowing multiple virtual networks to be created on the same physical network infrastructure.
+ Hardware virtualization: This involves creating a virtual version of a hardware device, such as a processor or memory, allowing multiple operating systems or applications to share the same hardware resources.

## Why You need Virtualization?

There are several reasons why organizations may choose to use virtualization:
+ Improved resource utilization: Virtualization allows multiple operating systems and applications to run on the same physical server or device, allowing organizations to make more efficient use of their hardware resources.
+ Reduced hardware costs: By using virtualization, organizations can reduce the number of physical servers and devices they need to purchase, as multiple operating systems and applications can be run on the same hardware.
+ Improved flexibility and scalability: Virtualization allows organizations to quickly and easily create and deploy new virtual environments, making it easier to respond to changing business needs.
+ Improved disaster recovery and business continuity: Virtualization allows organizations to create and maintain copies of their virtual environments, making it easier to recover from disasters or disruptions.
+ Improved security: Virtualization can be used to create isolated environments for sensitive applications and data, improving security and reducing the risk of data breaches.


## How Virtualization Works?

Virtualization works by creating a layer of software called a hypervisor, which sits between the physical hardware and the operating system and applications. The hypervisor allows multiple operating systems and applications to run on the same physical hardware, and allocates the necessary resources (such as CPU, memory, and storage) to each virtual environment as needed.

When a user interacts with a virtual environment, they are actually interacting with the hypervisor, which translates their actions into instructions for the physical hardware. This allows the user to interact with the virtual environment as if it were a separate physical device, even though it is running on the same hardware as other virtual environments.

Virtualization can be used to create virtual versions of servers, desktops, storage devices, networks, and other resources. It allows organizations to make more efficient use of their hardware resources, reduce costs, and improve flexibility and scalability.
