## VM Cloning
VMware VM Cloning is a feature that allows users to create an exact copy of an existing virtual machine (VM) in VMware vSphere. The clone is an independent and fully functional VM that can be used for a variety of purposes, such as creating a test environment, deploying multiple VMs with similar configurations, or creating backups. The process of cloning a VM involves creating a copy of the virtual machine's configuration file and all of its associated files, such as virtual disks. The clone can then be customized as needed and powered on to create a new, independent VM.
