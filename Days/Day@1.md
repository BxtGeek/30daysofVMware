## Introduction
Hello Reader, Welcome to 30DaysofVMware. This is a small initiative by me to educate people about VMware.
For virtualization, there are lots of tools in the market but VMware is one of the prominent ones. If you are working in IT there are 99% chances that you encountered VMware.
With the help of this repository will try to learn about VMware in the next 30 days. Hope you are equally excited as I am. So buckle up your seat belt and let's get started.
