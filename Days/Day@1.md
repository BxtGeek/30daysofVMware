# Day#1

## Introduction?

Hello Reader, Welcome to 30DaysofVMware. This is a small initiative by me to educate people about VMware and Virtualization.

For virtualization, there are lots of tools in the market but VMware is one of the prominent ones. If you are working in IT there are 99% chances that you encountered VMware.

With the help of this repository will try to learn about VMware in the next 30 days. Hope you are equally excited as I am. So buckle up your seat belt and let's get started.

## How to get started?

This is a fun learning model. You need to learn something new every day from this repo and share your knowledge with others. Now you will ask how I can share my knowledge. That is so simple. You need to share your learning over Twitter and don't forget to add #30DaysofVMware. This will trigger the #30DaysofVMware bot. 

Now let's start with day#2
