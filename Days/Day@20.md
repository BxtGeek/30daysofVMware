## Hosts & Clusters and VMs

In VMware vCenter, a host refers to a physical server that runs VMware vSphere and manages virtual machines (VMs). Hosts are the foundation of a virtualized environment, providing the resources that are required to run VMs. A host can have multiple processors, memory, storage, and network interfaces, all of which can be allocated to VMs.

A cluster is a group of hosts that are managed together and can share resources such as storage and network. Clusters are used to increase the availability, scalability, and manageability of virtualized environments. By grouping multiple hosts together, a cluster can provide redundancy and failover capabilities in case of host failure. Additionally, clusters enable the dynamic allocation of resources between VMs, allowing for more efficient use of resources and better performance.

VMs are virtualized versions of physical machines that can run on a host or within a cluster. They have their own operating system and can run applications just like physical machines do. VMs are created and managed within vCenter, and can be moved or copied between hosts or clusters as needed. This allows for flexibility in managing virtualized environments, and makes it easy to provision new VMs or scale existing ones.

vCenter is the central management platform for vSphere, allowing administrators to manage and monitor hosts, clusters, and VMs from a single location. Using vCenter, administrators can view the resources being used by each VM, monitor the performance of hosts and clusters, and make changes to the virtualized environment as needed. vCenter also provides a variety of tools and features for automating tasks, such as creating and deploying VMs, and for integrating with other IT systems.

vCenter also provides a variety of features to improve the security and compliance of virtualized environments. For example, vCenter can be configured to enforce security policies and to monitor for compliance with regulatory requirements. Additionally, vCenter can be integrated with other security systems, such as intrusion detection and prevention systems, to provide a comprehensive security solution.
